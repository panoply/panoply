<h4 align="center"><i>Point of focus and works</i></h4>
<p align="center">  
I primarily work with established apparel brands to deliver innovative headless/static commerce web app solutions for B2B and B2C businesses. I am currently focused on creating applications leveraging JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, Browser, Electron) languages running atop serverless architecture and cloud data technologies. I am extremely well versed and have extensive experience with SaaS platforms Shopify, Centra, Netlify, Google Cloud and AWS.

<h4 align="center"><i>Not your typical software engineer.</i></h4>

<p align="center">
Before discovering a passion for this field I was a professional boxer so my path to programming was different from most. I've been referred to as a <strong>rogue developer</strong> because outside of the digital realm my life, friends and interests are impertinent to this nexus. The provisional point of my interest in software engineering is sui generis of internet and without that it will cease to exist.

<h4 align="center"><i>Approaches and interests</i></h4>
<p align="center">
I have built various types of applications and toolings. Websites, webshops, ERPs, APIs, Parsers, Lexers, basic node utilities, text editor extensions/plugins and the list goes on. I am a huge advocate for the <a href="https://mithril.js.org">mithril.js</a> SPA framework and you can catch me in the mithril <a href="https://gitter.im/mithriljs/mithril.js">gitter</a> chat or on <a href="https://twitter.com/sisselsiv">twitter</a> either arguing with React developers or ranting about pugilism.
