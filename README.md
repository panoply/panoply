#### _HEJ / HELLO / HOI / PRIVET_

_My name is Niko. I primarily work with established apparel brands, fashion designers and fashion agencies alike creating innovative B2B, B2C commerce web app solutions. I produce and deliver highly performant consumer facing web-based applications written in JavaScript/TypeScript, Elixir and various other languages that operate atop of serverless architecture and cloud database technologies._

_I have an esoteric stack taste and tend to avoid leveraging the "groupthink" choices. I am a huge advocate for [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) and tend work exclusively with the framework for SPA (headless) projects._
