#### _HEJ / HELLO / HOI / PRIVET_

_My name is Niko. I primarily work with established apparel brands, fashion designers and fashion agencies alike creating innovative headless/static commerce web app solutions for B2B and B2C businesses. Currently I'm focused on creating applications using Elixir, JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, Browser, Electron) languages atop of serverless architecture and cloud databasing technologies._

_I have an esoteric stack taste and tend to avoid leveraging the "groupthink" choices. I am a huge advocate for [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) and tend work exclusively with the framework for SPA (headless) projects._
