#### _HEJ / HELLO / HOI / PRIVET_

_My name is Nik. I primarily work with established apparel brands, fashion designers and fashion agencies alike creating innovative headless/static commerce web app solutions for B2B and B2C businesses. Currently I'm focused on creating applications using Elixir, JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, Browser, Electron) languages atop of serverless architecture and cloud databasing technologies._

_I am not your typical software engineer. I work rogue in this nexus with an esoteric stack taste._
