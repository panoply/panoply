<h4><i>Panoply</i></h4>
<p>
<i>I develop, design and deliver various types of applications, modules and developer tooling. Creating parsers/lexers, websites, webshops, ERPs, APIs, IDE extensions/plugins written in JavaScript/TypeScript. You can typically reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/niksavvidis">X</a> discussing pugilism (boxing) and code.</i>
</p>

<h4><i>Nexus</i></h4>
<p>  
<i>I've primarily worked with established apparel brands delivering innovative headless and static commerce solutions at scale, serving both B2B and B2C markets atop of SaaS platforms Shopify, Centra, Netlify, Google Cloud and AWS. Currently, I am developing enterprise software and web application/s for music and digital signage leveraging <a href="https://sinjs.com" target="_blank">sin.js<a/>.

<h4><i>Cloth</i></h4>
<p><i>I'm cut from a different cloth and my path to programming differs from most. Prior to entering this industry, I boxed professionally and made money prize fighting. The provisional point of my interest in software engineering is sui generis of internet and outside the digital realm my day job, my life, my hobbies and my friends are impertinent to the programming nexus.</i>
